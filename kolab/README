A CentOS7 based container running kolab

== Build ==
To build the container with all packages installed run the build.sh script.
This will produce an image called kolab1:latest.

Because we can't setup-kolab in the initial image building this needs to be done separately:
* use setupkolab.sh to run a container, run setup-kolab in that container, and commit the result to a new image called kolab1:setup

You now have an image kolab1:setup that you can run using run.sh and then access using localhost/roundcube.

To login to kolab-webadmin use:
    Name: cn=Directory Manager
    Password: test

== Run ==
Once you have built kolab1:setup, you can use the run.sh script to start the container.
To avoid the container from being destryed once stopped, remove the --rm option from the script.

Use the getshell.sh script for an interactive shell.
