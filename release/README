# bin/performrelease.py
this will fetch the current tags for source dir
cerate a tar bal is a new tag is found
pull the changes from obs into the debian repo, so make sure that there is doff between obs and debian git
push updates to debian git if needed

# push git repos 
after running the relase processs the debian repos must be pushed to github again. We can't do this in docker because we have not access to ssh-keys.

cd ~/kdebuild/kdepim/debian; for i in `find -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d `; do echo $i; cd $i; git push; cd ..; done
